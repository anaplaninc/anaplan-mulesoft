Distribution Obligations.&#xA;&#xA;3.1 Application of License.&#xA;The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by&#xA;the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source&#xA;Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this&#xA;License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You&#xA;must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You&#xA;distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version&#xA;that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the&#xA;recipients&apos; rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document&#xA;offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.&#xA;&#xA;3.2 Availability of Source Code.&#xA;Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made&#xA;available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same&#xA;media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution&#xA;Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if&#xA;made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for&#xA;at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at&#xA;least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification&#xA;has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring&#xA;that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic&#xA;Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.&#xA;&#xA;3.3 Description of Modifications.&#xA;You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file&#xA;documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any&#xA;change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is&#xA;derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial&#xA;Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source&#xA;Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in&#xA;which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.&#xA;&#xA;3.4 Intellectual Property Matters&#xA;&#xA;(a) Third Party Claims.&#xA;If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party&apos;s intellectual&#xA;property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor&#xA;under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source&#xA;Code distribution titled &quot;LEGAL&quot; which describes the claim and the party making&#xA;the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If&#xA;Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as&#xA;described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in&#xA;all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps&#xA;(such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably&#xA;calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has&#xA;been obtained.&#xA;&#xA;(b) Contributor APIs.&#xA;If Contributor&apos;s Modifications include an application programming interface and&#xA;Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to&#xA;implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL&#xA;file.&#xA;&#xA;(c) Representations.&#xA;Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a)&#xA;above, Contributor believes that Contributor&apos;s Modifications are Contributor&apos;s&#xA;original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the&#xA;rights conveyed by this License.&#xA;&#xA;3.5 Required Notices.&#xA;You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If&#xA;it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to&#xA;its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a&#xA;relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If&#xA;You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor&#xA;to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in&#xA;any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients&apos; rights or&#xA;ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to&#xA;charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one&#xA;or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own&#xA;behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must&#xA;make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability&#xA;obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the&#xA;Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the&#xA;Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,&#xA;indemnity or liability terms You offer.&#xA;&#xA;3.6 Distribution of Executable Versions.&#xA;You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of&#xA;Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice&#xA;stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the&#xA;terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have&#xA;fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously&#xA;included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or&#xA;collateral in which You describe recipients&apos; rights relating to the Covered&#xA;Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership&#xA;rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from&#xA;this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License&#xA;and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or&#xA;alter the recipient&apos;s rights in the Source Code version from the rights set&#xA;forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a&#xA;different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ&#xA;from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer,&#xA;Original Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the&#xA;Initial Developer, Original Developer and every Contributor for any liability&#xA;incurred by the Initial Developer, Original Developer or such Contributor as a&#xA;result of any such terms You offer.&#xA;&#xA;3.7 Larger Works.&#xA;You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not&#xA;governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single&#xA;product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are&#xA;fulfilled for the Covered Code.&#xA;&#xA;4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.&#xA;If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with&#xA;respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or&#xA;regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the&#xA;maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they&#xA;affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in&#xA;Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code.&#xA;Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must&#xA;be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to&#xA;understand it.&#xA;&#xA;5. Application of this License.&#xA;This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the&#xA;notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.&#xA;&#xA;6. Versions of the License.&#xA;&#xA;6.1 New Versions.&#xA;MuleSoft, Inc. (&quot;MuleSoft&quot;) may publish revised and/or new versions of the&#xA;License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version&#xA;number.&#xA;&#xA;6.2 Effect of New Versions.&#xA;Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License,&#xA;You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also&#xA;choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the&#xA;License published by MuleSoft. No one other than MuleSoft has the right to&#xA;modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.&#xA;&#xA;6.3 Derivative Works.&#xA;If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do&#xA;in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this&#xA;License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases &quot;MuleSoft&quot;,&#xA;&quot;CPAL&quot; or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except&#xA;to note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it&#xA;clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the&#xA;CPAL. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Developer,&#xA;Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of&#xA;themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)&#xA;&#xA;7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.&#xA;COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT&#xA;WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT&#xA;LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE,&#xA;FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE&#xA;QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE&#xA;PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ORIGINAL&#xA;DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING,&#xA;REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART&#xA;OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER&#xA;THIS DISCLAIMER.&#xA;&#xA;8. TERMINATION.&#xA;&#xA;8.1 This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically&#xA;if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30&#xA;days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which&#xA;are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions&#xA;which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this&#xA;License shall survive.&#xA;&#xA;8.2 If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim&#xA;(excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer, Original&#xA;Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer, Original Developer or&#xA;Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as &quot;Participant&quot;)&#xA;alleging that:&#xA;&#xA;(a) such Participant&apos;s Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes&#xA;any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under&#xA;Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from&#xA;Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of&#xA;notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable&#xA;reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such&#xA;Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the&#xA;Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a&#xA;reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in&#xA;writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights&#xA;granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically&#xA;terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.&#xA;&#xA;(b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant&apos;s&#xA;Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any&#xA;rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are&#xA;revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had&#xA;made, Modifications made by that Participant.&#xA;&#xA;8.3 If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that&#xA;such Participant&apos;s Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any&#xA;patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to&#xA;the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of&#xA;the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be&#xA;taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or&#xA;license.&#xA;&#xA;8.4 In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user&#xA;license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been&#xA;validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall&#xA;survive termination.&#xA;&#xA;9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.&#xA;UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING&#xA;NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ORIGINAL&#xA;DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY&#xA;SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT,&#xA;SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING,&#xA;WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER&#xA;FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN&#xA;IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS&#xA;LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL&#xA;INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY&apos;S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW&#xA;PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR&#xA;LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND&#xA;LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.&#xA;&#xA;10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.&#xA;The Covered Code is a &quot;commercial item,&quot; as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R.&#xA;2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of &quot;commercial computer software&quot; and &quot;commercial&#xA;computer software documentation,&quot; as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212&#xA;(Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through&#xA;227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with&#xA;only those rights set forth herein.&#xA;&#xA;11. MISCELLANEOUS.&#xA;This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof.&#xA;If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision&#xA;shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This&#xA;License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to the extent&#xA;applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law&#xA;provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen&#xA;of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United States of&#xA;America, any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the&#xA;jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with&#xA;venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible&#xA;for costs, including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys&apos;&#xA;fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts&#xA;for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or&#xA;regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed&#xA;against the drafter shall not apply to this License.&#xA;&#xA;12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.&#xA;As between Initial Developer, Original Developer and the Contributors, each&#xA;party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out&#xA;of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with&#xA;Initial Developer, Original Developer and Contributors to distribute such&#xA;responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be&#xA;deemed to constitute any admission of liability.&#xA;&#xA;13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.&#xA;Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as&#xA;Multiple-Licensed. Multiple-Licensed means that the Initial Developer permits&#xA;you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of the CPAL or the&#xA;alternative licenses, if any, specified by the Initial Developer in the file&#xA;described in Exhibit A.&#xA;&#xA;14. ADDITIONAL TERM: ATTRIBUTION&#xA;&#xA;(a) As a modest attribution to the organizer of the development of the&#xA;Original Code (&quot;Original Developer&quot;), in the hope that its promotional value may&#xA;help justify the time, money and effort invested in writing the Original Code,&#xA;the Original Developer may include in Exhibit B (&quot;Attribution Information&quot;) a&#xA;requirement that each time an Executable and Source Code or a Larger Work is&#xA;launched or initially run (which includes initiating a session), a prominent&#xA;display of the Original Developer&apos;s Attribution Information (as defined below)&#xA;must occur on the graphic user interface employed by the end user to access such&#xA;Covered Code (which may include display on a splash screen), if any. The size&#xA;of the graphic image should be consistent with the size of the other elements of&#xA;the Attribution Information. If the access by the end user to the Executable and&#xA;Source Code does not create a graphic user interface for access to the Covered&#xA;Code, this obligation shall not apply. If the Original Code displays such&#xA;Attribution Information in a particular form (such as in the form of a splash&#xA;screen, notice at login, an &quot;about&quot; display, or dedicated attribution area on&#xA;user interface screens), continued use of such form for that Attribution&#xA;Information is one way of meeting this requirement for notice.&#xA;&#xA;(b) Attribution information may only include a copyright notice, a brief&#xA;phrase, graphic image and a URL (&quot;Attribution Information&quot;) and is subject to&#xA;the Attribution Limits as defined below. For these purposes, prominent shall&#xA;mean display for sufficient duration to give reasonable notice to the user of&#xA;the identity of the Original Developer and that if You include Attribution&#xA;Information or similar information for other parties, You must ensure that the&#xA;Attribution Information for the Original Developer shall be no less prominent&#xA;than such Attribution Information or similar information for the other party.&#xA;For greater certainty, the Original Developer may choose to specify in Exhibit B&#xA;below that the above attribution requirement only applies to an Executable and&#xA;Source Code resulting from the Original Code or any Modification, but not a&#xA;Larger Work. The intent is to provide for reasonably modest attribution,&#xA;therefore the Original Developer cannot require that You display, at any time,&#xA;more than the following information as Attribution Information: (a) a copyright&#xA;notice including the name of the Original Developer; (b) a word or one phrase&#xA;(not exceeding 10 words); (c) one graphic image provided by the Original&#xA;Developer; and (d) a URL (collectively, the &quot;Attribution Limits&quot;).&#xA;&#xA;(c) If Exhibit B does not include any Attribution Information, then there&#xA;are no requirements for You to display any Attribution Information of the&#xA;Original Developer.&#xA;&#xA;(d) You acknowledge that all trademarks, service marks and/or trade names&#xA;contained within the Attribution Information distributed with the Covered Code&#xA;are the exclusive property of their owners and may only be used with the&#xA;permission of their owners, or under circumstances otherwise permitted by law or&#xA;as expressly set out in this License.&#xA;&#xA;15. ADDITIONAL TERM: NETWORK USE.&#xA;The term &quot;External Deployment&quot; means the use, distribution, or communication of&#xA;the Original Code or Modifications in any way such that the Original Code or&#xA;Modifications may be used by anyone other than You, whether those works are&#xA;distributed or communicated to those persons or made available as an application&#xA;intended for use over a network. As an express condition for the grants of&#xA;license hereunder, You must treat any External Deployment by You of the Original&#xA;Code or Modifications as a distribution under section 3.1 and make Source Code&#xA;available under Section 3.2.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;EXHIBIT A. Common Public Attribution License Version 1.0.&#xA;&quot;The contents of this file are subject to the Common Public Attribution License&#xA;Version 1.0 (the &quot;License&quot;); you may not use this file except in compliance with&#xA;the License.

If the executable program does not launch a user interface, the&#xA;Company name and URL shall be included in the notice section of each file of the&#xA;Covered Code. :&#xA;&#xA;Display of Attribution Information is required in Larger Works which are defined&#xA;in the CPAL as a work which combines Covered Code or portions thereof with code&#xA;not governed by the terms of the CPAL.

Distribution Obligations.&#xA;&#xA;3.1 Application of License.&#xA;The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by&#xA;the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source&#xA;Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this&#xA;License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You&#xA;must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You&#xA;distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version&#xA;that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the&#xA;recipients&apos; rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document&#xA;offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.&#xA;&#xA;3.2 Availability of Source Code.&#xA;Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made&#xA;available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same&#xA;media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution&#xA;Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if&#xA;made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for&#xA;at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at&#xA;least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification&#xA;has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring&#xA;that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic&#xA;Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.&#xA;&#xA;3.3 Description of Modifications.&#xA;You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file&#xA;documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any&#xA;change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is&#xA;derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial&#xA;Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source&#xA;Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in&#xA;which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.&#xA;&#xA;3.4 Intellectual Property Matters&#xA;&#xA;(a) Third Party Claims.&#xA;If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party&apos;s intellectual&#xA;property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor&#xA;under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source&#xA;Code distribution titled &quot;LEGAL&quot; which describes the claim and the party making&#xA;the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If&#xA;Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as&#xA;described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in&#xA;all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps&#xA;(such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably&#xA;calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has&#xA;been obtained.&#xA;&#xA;(b) Contributor APIs.&#xA;If Contributor&apos;s Modifications include an application programming interface and&#xA;Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to&#xA;implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL&#xA;file.&#xA;&#xA;(c) Representations.&#xA;Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a)&#xA;above, Contributor believes that Contributor&apos;s Modifications are Contributor&apos;s&#xA;original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the&#xA;rights conveyed by this License.&#xA;&#xA;3.5 Required Notices.&#xA;You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If&#xA;it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to&#xA;its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a&#xA;relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If&#xA;You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor&#xA;to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in&#xA;any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients&apos; rights or&#xA;ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to&#xA;charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one&#xA;or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own&#xA;behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must&#xA;make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability&#xA;obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the&#xA;Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the&#xA;Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,&#xA;indemnity or liability terms You offer.&#xA;&#xA;3.6 Distribution of Executable Versions.&#xA;You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of&#xA;Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice&#xA;stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the&#xA;terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have&#xA;fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously&#xA;included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or&#xA;collateral in which You describe recipients&apos; rights relating to the Covered&#xA;Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership&#xA;rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from&#xA;this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License&#xA;and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or&#xA;alter the recipient&apos;s rights in the Source Code version from the rights set&#xA;forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a&#xA;different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ&#xA;from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer,&#xA;Original Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the&#xA;Initial Developer, Original Developer and every Contributor for any liability&#xA;incurred by the Initial Developer, Original Developer or such Contributor as a&#xA;result of any such terms You offer.&#xA;&#xA;3.7 Larger Works.&#xA;You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not&#xA;governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single&#xA;product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are&#xA;fulfilled for the Covered Code.&#xA;&#xA;4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.&#xA;If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with&#xA;respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or&#xA;regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the&#xA;maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they&#xA;affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in&#xA;Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code.&#xA;Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must&#xA;be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to&#xA;understand it.&#xA;&#xA;5. Application of this License.&#xA;This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the&#xA;notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.&#xA;&#xA;6. Versions of the License.&#xA;&#xA;6.1 New Versions.&#xA;MuleSoft, Inc. (&quot;MuleSoft&quot;) may publish revised and/or new versions of the&#xA;License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version&#xA;number.&#xA;&#xA;6.2 Effect of New Versions.&#xA;Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License,&#xA;You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also&#xA;choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the&#xA;License published by MuleSoft. No one other than MuleSoft has the right to&#xA;modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.&#xA;&#xA;6.3 Derivative Works.&#xA;If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do&#xA;in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this&#xA;License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases &quot;MuleSoft&quot;,&#xA;&quot;CPAL&quot; or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except&#xA;to note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it&#xA;clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the&#xA;CPAL. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Developer,&#xA;Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of&#xA;themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)&#xA;&#xA;7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.&#xA;COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT&#xA;WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT&#xA;LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE,&#xA;FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE&#xA;QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE&#xA;PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ORIGINAL&#xA;DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING,&#xA;REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART&#xA;OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER&#xA;THIS DISCLAIMER.&#xA;&#xA;8. TERMINATION.&#xA;&#xA;8.1 This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically&#xA;if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30&#xA;days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which&#xA;are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions&#xA;which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this&#xA;License shall survive.&#xA;&#xA;8.2 If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim&#xA;(excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer, Original&#xA;Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer, Original Developer or&#xA;Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as &quot;Participant&quot;)&#xA;alleging that:&#xA;&#xA;(a) such Participant&apos;s Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes&#xA;any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under&#xA;Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from&#xA;Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of&#xA;notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable&#xA;reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such&#xA;Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the&#xA;Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a&#xA;reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in&#xA;writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights&#xA;granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically&#xA;terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.&#xA;&#xA;(b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant&apos;s&#xA;Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any&#xA;rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are&#xA;revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had&#xA;made, Modifications made by that Participant.&#xA;&#xA;8.3 If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that&#xA;such Participant&apos;s Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any&#xA;patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to&#xA;the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of&#xA;the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be&#xA;taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or&#xA;license.&#xA;&#xA;8.4 In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user&#xA;license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been&#xA;validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall&#xA;survive termination.&#xA;&#xA;9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.&#xA;UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING&#xA;NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ORIGINAL&#xA;DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY&#xA;SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT,&#xA;SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING,&#xA;WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER&#xA;FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN&#xA;IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS&#xA;LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL&#xA;INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY&apos;S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW&#xA;PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR&#xA;LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND&#xA;LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.&#xA;&#xA;10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.&#xA;The Covered Code is a &quot;commercial item,&quot; as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R.&#xA;2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of &quot;commercial computer software&quot; and &quot;commercial&#xA;computer software documentation,&quot; as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212&#xA;(Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through&#xA;227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with&#xA;only those rights set forth herein.&#xA;&#xA;11. MISCELLANEOUS.&#xA;This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof.&#xA;If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision&#xA;shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This&#xA;License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to the extent&#xA;applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law&#xA;provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen&#xA;of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United States of&#xA;America, any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the&#xA;jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with&#xA;venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible&#xA;for costs, including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys&apos;&#xA;fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts&#xA;for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or&#xA;regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed&#xA;against the drafter shall not apply to this License.&#xA;&#xA;12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.&#xA;As between Initial Developer, Original Developer and the Contributors, each&#xA;party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out&#xA;of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with&#xA;Initial Developer, Original Developer and Contributors to distribute such&#xA;responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be&#xA;deemed to constitute any admission of liability.&#xA;&#xA;13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.&#xA;Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as&#xA;Multiple-Licensed. Multiple-Licensed means that the Initial Developer permits&#xA;you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of the CPAL or the&#xA;alternative licenses, if any, specified by the Initial Developer in the file&#xA;described in Exhibit A.&#xA;&#xA;14. ADDITIONAL TERM: ATTRIBUTION&#xA;&#xA;(a) As a modest attribution to the organizer of the development of the&#xA;Original Code (&quot;Original Developer&quot;), in the hope that its promotional value may&#xA;help justify the time, money and effort invested in writing the Original Code,&#xA;the Original Developer may include in Exhibit B (&quot;Attribution Information&quot;) a&#xA;requirement that each time an Executable and Source Code or a Larger Work is&#xA;launched or initially run (which includes initiating a session), a prominent&#xA;display of the Original Developer&apos;s Attribution Information (as defined below)&#xA;must occur on the graphic user interface employed by the end user to access such&#xA;Covered Code (which may include display on a splash screen), if any. The size&#xA;of the graphic image should be consistent with the size of the other elements of&#xA;the Attribution Information. If the access by the end user to the Executable and&#xA;Source Code does not create a graphic user interface for access to the Covered&#xA;Code, this obligation shall not apply. If the Original Code displays such&#xA;Attribution Information in a particular form (such as in the form of a splash&#xA;screen, notice at login, an &quot;about&quot; display, or dedicated attribution area on&#xA;user interface screens), continued use of such form for that Attribution&#xA;Information is one way of meeting this requirement for notice.&#xA;&#xA;(b) Attribution information may only include a copyright notice, a brief&#xA;phrase, graphic image and a URL (&quot;Attribution Information&quot;) and is subject to&#xA;the Attribution Limits as defined below. For these purposes, prominent shall&#xA;mean display for sufficient duration to give reasonable notice to the user of&#xA;the identity of the Original Developer and that if You include Attribution&#xA;Information or similar information for other parties, You must ensure that the&#xA;Attribution Information for the Original Developer shall be no less prominent&#xA;than such Attribution Information or similar information for the other party.&#xA;For greater certainty, the Original Developer may choose to specify in Exhibit B&#xA;below that the above attribution requirement only applies to an Executable and&#xA;Source Code resulting from the Original Code or any Modification, but not a&#xA;Larger Work. The intent is to provide for reasonably modest attribution,&#xA;therefore the Original Developer cannot require that You display, at any time,&#xA;more than the following information as Attribution Information: (a) a copyright&#xA;notice including the name of the Original Developer; (b) a word or one phrase&#xA;(not exceeding 10 words); (c) one graphic image provided by the Original&#xA;Developer; and (d) a URL (collectively, the &quot;Attribution Limits&quot;).&#xA;&#xA;(c) If Exhibit B does not include any Attribution Information, then there&#xA;are no requirements for You to display any Attribution Information of the&#xA;Original Developer.&#xA;&#xA;(d) You acknowledge that all trademarks, service marks and/or trade names&#xA;contained within the Attribution Information distributed with the Covered Code&#xA;are the exclusive property of their owners and may only be used with the&#xA;permission of their owners, or under circumstances otherwise permitted by law or&#xA;as expressly set out in this License.&#xA;&#xA;15. ADDITIONAL TERM: NETWORK USE.&#xA;The term &quot;External Deployment&quot; means the use, distribution, or communication of&#xA;the Original Code or Modifications in any way such that the Original Code or&#xA;Modifications may be used by anyone other than You, whether those works are&#xA;distributed or communicated to those persons or made available as an application&#xA;intended for use over a network. As an express condition for the grants of&#xA;license hereunder, You must treat any External Deployment by You of the Original&#xA;Code or Modifications as a distribution under section 3.1 and make Source Code&#xA;available under Section 3.2.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;EXHIBIT A.
